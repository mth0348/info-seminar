\section*{Abstract}
Random number generation has been an ongoing research topic for a long time now and is still being expanded today.
There are many different aspects of what allows for reliable generation of random numbers.
One of the core elements in the concept of randomness in computer science is the \emph{entropy source}.
\newline
This document establishes fundamental knowledge about entropy sources and how random numbers are generated through the use of randomness extractors and pseudo-random number generators.
Not only reliability of random number generation, but also the security of the algorithms play a major role.
How can one achieve a random number generation system that is equally ideal in both randomness and security?
Ultimately, no one should be able to interfere in the process, as it would render the idea randomness invalid.
