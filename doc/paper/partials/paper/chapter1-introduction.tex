\section{Introduction}
This document is written with the intent to explore how entropy sources are chosen and evaluated, hence a fundamental knowledge about computer science is required.

Randomness and random numbers play a major role in the fields of computer science, especially in security and cryptography. However, it proved to be rather problematic to find a number generation system that is both "reliably" random and secure. To find out how and if a truly random number can even be generated, one has to understand the concept of \emph{information entropy} and \emph{entropy sources} first.
\newline
From there, one can expand to \emph{randomness extractors}, algorithms created with the intend to generate a random number from a strong entropy source with the aid of a so-called \emph{random seed}. Of course, for the extractor to be ideal, it needs to be able to extract a random number that no one should be able to predict.
